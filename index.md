## About the Data

The data we'll be using today is drawn from multiple sources.  The CBC has pubished two articles on police violence, one in [2018](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform-custom/deadly-force) and another in [2020](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/fatalpoliceencounters/).  But there are numerous issues with their data as I've mentioned in lecture.  Additionally, there is [killercopscanada](https://killercopscanada.wordpress.com/) a wordpress blog with texts posts detailing incidents of police involved deaths that started in 2015.  The Georgia Straight published a database of police-involved deaths in (2017)[https://www.straight.com/news/1009886/police-involved-deaths-bc-rise-third-consecutive-year] that has records from 2003 - 2017.  Additionally, there is a ["Coalition Contre La Repression et les Asus Policiers"](https://www.lacrap.org/liste-des-noms-des-personnes-decedees-aux-mains-de-la-police-au-canada) a fracophone database of names and ages dating back to 1987.  I have been working to compile these disparate data sets and add any other missing records where applicaable.  Today, you will be working with a subset of that data for British Columbia spanning June 2011 - May 2021.
