# Further Analysis

Download the geocoded points layer and import it into ArcGIS Pro.  Then download a census variable of your choice (other than total population) from simply analytics.  You can focus on the whole province or more specifically on one region.  Make a map showing the point data overlaid above the census data and submit it to canvas.
